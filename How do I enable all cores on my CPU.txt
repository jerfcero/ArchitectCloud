How do I enable all cores on my CPU?
1. Use a different monitoring tool
task manager cpu
Sometimes this issue can be a simple display bug from Task Manager. Simply restart the PC and check again.
If the number of cores and threads are still inconsistent, you should try using a different monitoring tool for your CPU.

Press Windows + R
This will open the Run menu
Type in MSConfig
Go to the Boot tab
boot advanced settings
Select Advanced Options
Look at where it says Number of processors
If the checkbox is enabled, uncheck it
Your system should now use all of its processors whenever given the chance
set number of cores
Reboot the PC
Open the Task Manager or any other monitoring program to view the number co cores. You should see the right number now.

Note: By design, this system setting can only be used to reduce the number of cores your CPU uses, since the system’s goal is always to make the most of your processors.

That being said, if you do find this system setting modified to less than the default value, it may be the result of another software’s tampering.
